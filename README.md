🕹️ Smart Tic-Tac-Toe
A modern, high-performance Tic-Tac-Toe web application featuring a "Smart" Computer AI, built with a sleek Glassmorphism UI and responsive design.

🌟 Key Features
Smart Computer AI: Unlike basic versions, this AI evaluates the board to block your moves and takes strategic positions (like the Center) to win.

Player Customization: Start the game by choosing your side (X or O). The game dynamically adjusts the logic based on your choice.

Modern Glassmorphism UI: Features a frosted-glass effect over a high-quality wooden background using advanced CSS backdrop-filter.

Fully Responsive: Optimized for all screen sizes—from mobile phones to large desktops.

Dynamic Win Detection: Instantly calculates 8 different winning patterns across rows, columns, and diagonals.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Structured semantic markup.

CSS3: Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Glassmorphism styling.

JavaScript (ES6): State management, DOM manipulation, and automated AI logic.
